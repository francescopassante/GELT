# GELT — Gauge-Equivariant Neural Networks for Lattice Gauge Theory

Master's thesis codebase. Goal: build a **gauge-equivariant graph-attention
network (or transformer) (GELT - gauge equivariant lattice transformer)**
for SU(N_c) lattice gauge theory, starting from 2D Z₂ as
a debug-friendly testbed and scaling toward U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3) and 3+1D.

The architecture follows the L-CNN framework (Favoni et al. 2012.12901)
for primitives and gauge-equivariance proofs, with two departures:
(i) the L-Conv + L-Bilin stack is replaced by an attention block whose
**value path is matrix-bilinear** (`α · Q† · Ṽ`), so L-CNN's loop-doubling
universality argument transfers directly; (ii) parallel transport between
sites is **averaged over all shortest lattice paths** in the L1-ball of
Manhattan radius R (computed by a DP recursion, not enumeration), so each
block already reaches the full L1-ball receptive field with non-axis-aligned
loop content.

## Documents

All in `notes/`. (The previous `architecture.html` and `roadmap.html` were
removed pending rewrites; the spec now lives across the notes below.)

- `notes/abstract.md` — the thesis abstract: GELT as a gauge-equivariant
  attention encoder, gauge-invariant scores + matrix-bilinear value path,
  L1-ball shortest-path transport, RoPE geometric prior, and the
  interpretability program (attention vs. topology / correlation length).
- `notes/GELTsummary.md` — plain-language tour of the codebase modules
  (lattice / sampler / data / blocks) and a step-by-step walk through the
  `GELT` forward pass and the `GEMHSA` layer.
- `notes/explainability.md` — the thesis spine: *the attention map is a
  measurement*. Why equivariance makes attention physically interpretable,
  the three interpretability studies (emergent correlation length,
  localization on topological lumps, head/layer specialization), and how to
  run them (extract `_last_alpha`, ablation/intervention, validation against
  cooled `q(x)` / `ξ(β)`).
- `notes/fable_audit.md` — a code+notes audit (architecture / efficiency /
  explainability feasibility) with a prioritized to-do list. The current
  source of truth for known issues; the "Suggested next steps" section
  below mirrors it.
- `notes/papers_review.md` — full literature review of L-CNN, the
  gauge-covariant ResNet (Nagai-Tomiya 2103.11965), and CASK (2501.16955).
  Sections 0 (lattice primer) and 1 (L-CNN) are the architecture
  prerequisites.
- `notes/sampling.md` — strategy notes for the MC sampler (single-site
  Metropolis for Z₂; heat-bath + overrelaxation now implemented for SU(2),
  extension plan to U(1)/SU(3)).
- `notes/resources.md` — curated textbooks, lecture notes, and ML-for-LGT
  papers with suggested reading order.
- `notes/tunnel-visualization.md` — exploratory notes on visualising
  what the topological-charge network learns about the QCD vacuum.

## Status

Phase 0 (2D Z₂ implementation validation), extended toward SU(2): the
Metropolis sampler, the targets, and the GELT block now all support
`nc = 2`, and `validate_sampler_su2.py` / `validate_sampler_z2.py` validate
the Metropolis sampler for each group.

The codebase was refactored from the original OO scaffolding
(`Site` / `Link` / `Plaquette` / `Lattice` classes) to **pure tensor
operations** suitable for autograd, vectorisation, and clean generalisation
to U(1)/SU(N). It was then reorganised into a proper Python package:
`gelt/` (library), `scripts/` (entry points), `tests/` (pytest).

The **GELT block** exists in **two variants** that differ only in positional
encoding (≈ 90% shared code):

- **`gelt/blocks_rope.py`** — rotary positional encoding (RoPE) on the
  attention score. **This is the trained variant** (`scripts/train_gelt.py`
  imports `GELT` from here).
- **`gelt/blocks_bias.py`** — convolutional/offset bias on the score. This
  is the variant imported by `gelt/__init__.py` (`from gelt import GELT`),
  by `tests/test_blocks.py`, and by `scripts/check_gelt_invariance.py`.

Each variant provides `GEMHSA` (single equivariant attention layer),
`ChannelLift` (front-end width lift), `Trace`, `MLP`, and `GELT` (the full
model: `ChannelLift` → stacked `GEMHSA` blocks → `Trace` → per-site `MLP` →
spatial reduction).

A second baseline now lives in **`gelt/lcnn.py`**: the Favoni et al. L-CNN
(`LConv`, `LBilin`, `LCB`, `LAct`, `Trace`, `LCNN` + `build_axis_transports`),
the matched-parameter comparison target for the GELT.

Known caveats (see `notes/fable_audit.md` for the full list and the
prioritized fixes):

1. **The trained variant (`blocks_rope`) is the untested one.** The tests
   and the invariance check exercise `blocks_bias`. Parametrizing the
   equivariance tests over both modules is the cheap fix.
2. **(resolved)** The dead parameters are gone: `self.alpha` (ReZero) was
   deleted from both variants (the residual stays `W + W_act`, and the
   `alpha_init` plumbing was removed from `GEMHSA`/`GELT`/`train_gelt.py`),
   and `blocks_bias`'s `b_h` (bias) was restored to the score path (the
   bias add is live again). Both variants now have only live, trainable
   parameters, so the `test_blocks` backward case passes.
3. **RoPE axis coverage:** `pair_axis = [p % D for p in range(n_pairs)]`
   only rotates `n_pairs` axes, so in 4D with small `d_qkv` some axes get
   the identity rotation. Enforce `d_qkv ≥ 2D` for full coverage.

What still does **not** exist: a full worst-case-Ω stress test (only the
quick `check_gelt_invariance.py` exists); β in the datasets (needed for the
strong correlation-length study); cooling/smearing of `q(x)`; offset-chunked
attention (the memory gate on the explainability program at physical R);
non-Z₂/non-SU(2) production samplers.

## Layout

Library lives in `gelt/`; entry-point scripts in `scripts/`; pytest in
`tests/`. The package is installed editable via `pyproject.toml`.

### `gelt/`

- **`lattice.py`** — `GaugeGroup` ABC with `Z2` and `SU(N)` implementations;
  pure tensor functions:
  - `random_links(L, D, group, dtype)` → `(D, *Λ, nc, nc)`.
  - `plaquette_tensor(U, group)` → `(D(D-1)/2, *Λ, nc, nc)`.
  - `action(U, group, beta=1.0, plaquettes=None)` → scalar Wilson action
    `β Σ_p (1 − Re Tr P / nc)`.
  - `topological_charge_density(U, group, plaquettes=None)` → per-site
    naive (plaquette) charge density `q_x` (clover-free,
    `F_{μν} = (P − P†)/2i`).
  - `topological_charge(U, group, plaquettes=None)` → `Q = Σ_x q_x`, one
    scalar per config — the topology analogue of `action`.
  - `rectangular_wilson_loop(U, group, R, T, mu, nu)` → `Re Tr W/nc` at
    every site for the R×T loop in the (μ, ν) plane (R=T=1 is the plaquette).
  - `link_gauge_transformation(U, omega, group)` — apply site-local Ω to
    every link (`U_μ(x) → Ω(x) · U_μ(x) · Ω†(x+μ̂)`); used by the
    gauge-invariance unit tests and the GELT invariance check.
  - `local_gauge_transformation(W, omega, group)` — apply site-local Ω to
    an adjoint field (`W(x) → Ω(x) · W(x) · Ω†(x)`); used in the GELT
    equivariance tests.
  - `l1_ball_offsets(D, R)` → list of signed Δx tuples with
    `1 ≤ |Δx|_1 ≤ R`, ordered by `|Δx|_1`.
  - `build_transport_average(U, R, group, mode="average")` — DP routine that
    materialises transports `T_Δx(x)` over the full signed L1-ball. Expects
    batched links `(N, D, *Λ, nc, nc)`. `mode="average"` (default) is the
    shortest-path-averaged transport (rotation-symmetric, the architecture's
    default); `mode="single"` is a single-canonical-path variant (rotation
    symmetry broken — for A/B testing whether averaging dilutes a
    specific-path target).
- **`sampler.py`** — `staple_sum`, `metropolis_sweep` (checkerboard-
  vectorised single-site Metropolis; the proposal is routed by
  `_PROPOSAL_FN[type(group)]` — `_z2_proposal` (`U → −U`) and
  `_su2_proposal` (`U → V·U`, V near identity)); `mcmc_ensemble`
  (thermalise + decorrelate + collect, dispatches the sweep per group via
  `_SWEEP_FN`, **Metropolis is the registered default for both Z₂ and
  SU(2)**); `haar_ensemble` (Haar-uniform, ignores β — shares the sampler
  interface for sanity checks). To plug in U(1)/SU(N) later, add a proposal
  (and/or sweep) and register it in `_PROPOSAL_FN` / `_SWEEP_FN`.
  - **SU(2) heat-bath + overrelaxation** (`heatbath_sweep`,
    `overrelaxation_sweep`, and the combined `heatbath_overrelaxation_sweep`
    — 1 heat-bath + `n_or` OR sweeps) is the exact, no-tuning sampler that
    beats Metropolis critical slowing; it is the prerequisite for resolvable
    spectroscopy (see `notes/glueball_spectroscopy.md` §8). It is **opt-in,
    not the registry default** (so `validate_sampler_su2.py` still tests
    Metropolis): pass it as `sweep_fn=` to `mcmc_ensemble`, e.g.
    `functools.partial(heatbath_overrelaxation_sweep, n_or=4)`. Both sweeps
    share one checkerboard skeleton (`_su2_local_sweep`), differing only in
    the per-site update: heat-bath factors the staple `A = k·V`
    (`_su2_decompose_staple`), draws the scalar part via Creutz
    (`_sample_su2_w0`), and sets `U' = W·V†`; overrelaxation reflects
    `U' = V†·U†·V†`. Overrelaxation is microcanonical (action-preserving) but
    *expansive* off the group manifold, so each reflected link is re-projected
    onto SU(2) with the closed-form `_su2_from_quaternion`-style projector
    `_project_su2` (cheaper than `SU.project`'s SVD/det). SU(2) only — SU(N≥3)
    needs Cabibbo–Marinari.
  - **`integrated_autocorrelation_time(series, c=6, max_lag=None)`** — generic
    Markov-chain diagnostic: normalised autocorrelation `ρ(t)` and `τ_int`
    (Madras–Sokal automatic windowing, the proper version of the inline
    estimate in `validate_sampler_su2.py`) of any scalar chain observable.
    Returns `(rho, tau_int, window)`; samples `n_skip ≳ 2·τ_int` apart are
    effectively independent.
- **`data.py`** — `build_plaquette_datasets(N, D, L, group, target, ...)`.
  `target` is a callable `target(configs, group) -> Tensor` (use
  `functools.partial` to bind extra args, e.g.
  `partial(rectangular_wilson_loop, R=2, T=3, mu=0, nu=1)`).
  `structured=True` (default) keeps the full `(N, n_pairs, *Λ, nc, nc)`
  matrix layout for GELT; `structured=False` calls `flatten_color` (also in
  this module) to split color axes for the CNN baseline — real groups
  give `(D · nc², *Λ)`, complex groups split real/imag for
  `(2 · D · nc², *Λ)`. With `R` set, the transport is precomputed per config
  via `build_transport_average` (honoring `transport_mode`) and the splits
  yield `(X, T, y)` triples. `save=True` writes to `datasets/`;
  `load_plaquette_datasets(prefix, datasets_dir="datasets")` reloads them.
- **`cnn_baseline.py`** — `LatticeCNN(L, D, in_channels, hidden_channels,
  kernel_size=3)`. Non-equivariant CNN baseline; uses `Conv2d`/`Conv3d` for
  D=2/3 and a roll-based `_RollConvND` for D≥4.
- **`lcnn.py`** — Favoni et al. L-CNN (gauge-equivariant baseline):
  `build_axis_transports` (axis-aligned link products `U^(k)_μ(x)`, the
  L-CNN transport input — distinct from GELT's L1-ball `T`); `LConv`,
  `LBilin`, `LCB` (L-Conv-Bilin block), `LAct` (trace-gated activation),
  `Trace`, and `LCNN` (stacked L-CB(+L-Act) → `Trace` → per-site MLP →
  reduction). Mirrors `GELT`'s I/O so the two are matched-parameter
  comparable.
- **`blocks_rope.py` / `blocks_bias.py`** — the two GELT variants (see
  Status). `GEMHSA`: augment (append daggers + identity) → fused Q/Q_v/K/V
  projections → adjoint transport of K, V via `T`/`T_dag` → gauge-invariant
  score `Re Tr[Q† K̃]` (+ RoPE rotation or offset bias) → softmax →
  multiplicative value `Σ α · Q_v† · Ṽ` → channel mix → residual + L-Act
  gate. `GELT.forward(W, T)` computes `T_dag` once and threads
  `(T, T_dag)` through the stack. `_last_score` / `_last_alpha` are stashed
  per layer (under `no_grad`) for the interpretability program.
- **`__init__.py`** — re-exports `GELT` (from `blocks_bias`), `LatticeCNN`,
  the dataset builders, the `lattice` primitives, and the ensembles.

### `scripts/`

Each script is self-contained: it defines its own `evaluate` / `train_model`
loop inline (there is no shared `gelt/train.py`). Device order: cuda → mps
→ cpu.

- **`train_cnn.py`** — single-(L, β) run of the CNN baseline (`LatticeCNN`);
  `haar_ensemble`, a `rectangular_wilson_loop` target, target
  standardization, matched-capacity hyperparameters.
- **`train_gelt.py`** — single-(L, β, R) run of the GELT model (imports
  `GELT` from `blocks_rope`); `structured=True`, unpacks `(X, T, y)`,
  trains on a `topological_charge_density` target, passes `T` to
  `model(X, T)`, uses a `StepLR` scheduler. The minimal reference for how
  to train the architecture.
- **`train_lcnn.py`** — single-run of the Favoni L-CNN (`gelt.lcnn.LCNN`);
  mirrors `train_gelt.py` (same loop, split, standardisation, plotting) but
  feeds the axis-aligned `build_axis_transports` instead of the L1-ball `T`.
- **`check_gelt_invariance.py`** — quick gauge-invariance check on the full
  `GELT` (from `blocks_bias`): `forward(W_g, T_g) ≈ forward(W, T)` on SU(2).
- **`validate_sampler_su2.py`** / **`validate_sampler_z2.py`** — four-panel
  sanity checks on the Metropolis sampler (one per group): thermalisation,
  2D β-scan, 3D β-scan, plaquette autocorrelation. The 2D panel compares to
  the exact mean plaquette — `I₂(β)/I₁(β)` for SU(2), `tanh(β)` for Z₂ — and
  the 3D panel shows the SU(2) confining crossover vs. the Z₂ transition near
  `β_c ≈ 0.761`. Write `sampler_validation_su2.png` / `sampler_validation_z2.png`.
- **`measure_glueball.py`** — classical 0⁺⁺ baseline (`gelt.glueball`): four
  panels validating the correlator/`m_eff` code on a synthetic known mass and
  smearing monotonicity (top row), then the real-ensemble `C(Δ)` / `m_eff(Δ)`
  thin vs. smeared (bottom row). Samples via SU(2) heat-bath + overrelaxation.
  Writes `glueball_validation.png`.
- **`check_glueball_autocorrelation.py`** — step-1 pre-flight before
  `measure_glueball.py`: runs a long `n_skip=1` heat-bath+OR chain, builds the
  plaquette and the thin/smeared glueball operator per config, and reports
  `τ_int` (via `integrated_autocorrelation_time`) so the production `n_skip` can
  be set to `≳ 2·τ_int` of the smeared operator. Writes
  `glueball_autocorrelation.png`.

### `tests/`

- **`test_lattice.py`** — gauge-invariance checks on `plaquette_tensor` /
  `action` under `link_gauge_transformation` (bit-exact in Z₂ float64).
- **`test_data_model.py`** — split-validation and CNN-baseline shape
  guards.
- **`test_transport.py`** — coverage for `l1_ball_offsets` and
  `build_transport_average`: offset counts, brute-force per-octant pattern,
  octant-relation consistency, and gauge covariance under unitary Ω for
  both Z₂ and `nc = 2` complex.
- **`test_blocks.py`** — gauge equivariance of `GEMHSA` end-to-end
  (`forward(W_g, T_g) == Ω · forward(W, T) · Ω†`) for SU(2) in
  complex128 and Z₂ in float64; both gate branches; shape preservation
  and finite-grad backward pass on a batched SU(3) example. **Tests the
  `blocks_bias` variant** (not the trained `blocks_rope`); the full suite
  passes now that the dead parameters are resolved (see Status).
- **`test_sampler.py`** — SU(2) heat-bath + overrelaxation correctness:
  overrelaxation conserves the Wilson action to machine precision and stays
  on the group; heat-bath stays on the group and reproduces the *exact* 2D
  SU(2) mean plaquette `I₂(β)/I₁(β)` (the automated analogue of
  `validate_sampler_su2.py`'s 2D panel).

## Conventions

- **Tensor layouts** (the only spec, no OO wrappers):
  - Links: `(D, L, ..., L, nc, nc)`. Direction first, spatial axes,
    color axes last.
  - Plaquettes: `(n_pairs, L, ..., L, nc, nc)` with
    `n_pairs = D(D-1)/2`, ordered by `(μ, ν)` with `μ < ν` lexicographically.
- **Color axes are always present**, even for Z₂ where `nc = 1`. Every
  product is written as `A @ B` and every inverse as `group.dagger(A)`,
  so the code ports verbatim to U(1)/SU(N).
- **Plaquette convention:**
  `P_{μν}(x) = U_μ(x) · U_ν(x + μ̂) · U_μ†(x + ν̂) · U_ν†(x)`.
- **Periodic BCs:** `torch.roll` for shifts. Never manual modulo arithmetic
  on indices (it's harder to vectorise and harder to read).
- **Wilson action:** `S = β Σ_p (1 − Re Tr P / nc)`. β defaults to 1.0,
  reproducing the legacy unnormalised form `n_plaq − Σ P` for Z₂.
- **Parallel transport:** sum over **all** shortest lattice paths in the
  L1-ball — never a single axis-aligned path (unless `mode="single"`).
  `build_transport_average` expects batched links `(N, D, *Λ, nc, nc)` and
  materialises the full signed L1-ball in one `|Δx|_1`-ordered DP pass,
  using `U_μ(x)` for `Δx_μ > 0` steps and `U†_μ(x − ê_μ)` for `Δx_μ < 0`
  steps. The octant identity `T_{−Δx}(x) = dagger(T_Δx(x − Δx))` holds
  as a math property and is a test-suite consistency check; it is **not**
  relied on at build time (a single auditable DP surface is worth more
  than the 2× memory saving from canonical-offset storage, and mixed-sign
  offsets cannot be derived from positive-octant data anyway).
- **Float32** for training; pass `dtype=torch.float64` (→ `complex128`) through
  the dataset builders for high-precision gauge-invariance unit tests and
  worst-case-Ω drift reporting.

## The inductive-bias gap that motivates GELT

For Haar-random Z₂ links in 2D, every plaquette is ±1 with mean 0, and
plaquette pairs share either 0 or 2 links — both cases give zero
covariance, so plaquettes are independent under random ±1 links. With
`n_plaq = L²` independent ±1 contributions, `Var(action) = L²`, so an
absolute MSE that grows like L² is just the label scale growing — use
`R² = 1 − MSE / Var(y)` to compare across L. On Haar data, a CNN fed
**plaquettes** reaches R² ≈ 0.99 (the action is a linear sum of its inputs)
while a CNN fed **links** sits at R² ≈ 0 (no inductive bias for "multiply
four specific link values"). That gap is what the equivariant transport
provides. Even a perfect action regressor on Haar data is only memorising
the action *function*; β-dependent physics requires the Metropolis data
path, hence the MCMC samplers and the physical targets (action, topological
charge, Wilson loops).

## Things to keep in mind

- **Do not silently broadcast across color axes.** Every matmul should
  be explicit (`A @ B`) and every dagger explicit (`group.dagger(A)`);
  for Z₂ both are no-ops, but for U(1)/SU(N) any laxity is a bug that
  Z₂ cannot catch. The same applies to the GELT transport: a missed dagger
  or a wrong shortest-path step will pass Z₂ tests and fail at the first
  non-abelian Ω.
- **`blocks_rope` is trained but `blocks_bias` is tested.** Trust nothing
  about the RoPE variant's equivariance until the tests are parametrized
  over both modules; "should hold" is exactly what the stress test exists
  to replace.
- **`LatticeCNN` is 2D-only** (`Conv2d` with circular padding); raises
  `NotImplementedError` for `D ≠ 2`. Generalising means switching to
  `Conv3d`/`ConvNd` or factoring the convolution layer.
- **Datasets do not store β.** For multi-β training (and the strong
  correlation-length study), β should become part of the dataset so the
  model can be conditioned on it.
- **Sampler dispatch is by group type.** `metropolis_sweep` looks up
  `_PROPOSAL_FN[type(group)]` and `mcmc_ensemble` looks up
  `_SWEEP_FN[type(group)]`; adding U(1)/SU(N) is a registry entry plus the
  proposal/sweep function.
- **Do not remove comments unless asked to.**

## Suggested next steps

In priority order, per `notes/fable_audit.md` §4 (architecture work
gating the explainability program in `notes/explainability.md`):

1. ~~**Resolve the dead parameters** (`self.alpha` ReZero, `blocks_bias`'s
   `b_h`).~~ **Done:** `self.alpha` deleted (residual stays `W + W_act`),
   `b_h` restored; the `test_blocks` suite passes.
2. **Merge `blocks_bias`/`blocks_rope` into one `blocks.py`** with a
   `pos_encoding ∈ {"rope", "bias", "none"}` switch, and **parametrize the
   equivariance tests over all variants** (this is also the §7-style stress
   test the trained variant currently lacks).
3. **Enforce RoPE axis coverage** (`d_qkv ≥ 2D`; set `d_qkv=8` for D=4).
4. **Gate the `.item()` diagnostics** behind a flag (they force a GPU sync
   every layer/step); default off in training.
5. **Offset-chunked attention + on-the-fly transport** — the memory gate on
   the whole explainability program at physical R.
6. **Add cooling/smearing of `q(x)`** (prerequisite for the localization
   study) and **β in the dataset** (prerequisite for the strong correlation-
   length study).
7. **The thesis novelty** (per `notes/explainability.md`): the attention map
   as a *measurement* — emergent correlation length `ℓ_att(β)` vs `ξ(β)`,
   spatial localization on topological lumps, head/layer specialization —
   validated against lattice ground truth, plus the matched-parameter
   shootout vs. the L-CNN baseline.
